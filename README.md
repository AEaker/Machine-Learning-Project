# Machine-Learning-Project

Formula One Project

TL;DR:

Teammates laid HTML/CSS/etc ground work, some tableau charts, etc.


I threw images into a face recognition python library, entry form on website[through flask] allows you to upload an image OF YOUR OWN and it will return an image with Driver's highlighted with their names.
